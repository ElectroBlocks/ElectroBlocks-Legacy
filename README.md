## Description

I created a "drag and drop" app for programming the Arduino.   You use this with Serial Monitor, Bluetooth, NeoPixels, LED Matrix, IR Remotes and much more.  It also has a debug block which will pause the program and print out all the variables.  

You can also save and see the code view as well.  I will have a much more in through tour real soon.  I am working on updating my all the lessons and finishing everything off.

Windows Users,

I got the app signed by DigiCert, but because I am not an organization, thus I can not get the EV Code Sign Cert.   This means you will have to click on the more information the windows defender SmartScreen and click run anyways.
