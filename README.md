# ElectroBlocks - Arduino Blockly IDE

## Description

I created a "drag and drop" app for programming the Arduino.   You use this with Serial Monitor, Bluetooth, NeoPixels, LED Matrix, IR Remotes and much more.  It also has a debug block which will pause the program and print out all the variables.  

You can also save and see the code view as well.  I will have a much more in through tour real soon.  I am working on updating my all the lessons and finishing everything off.
